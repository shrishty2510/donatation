  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 10px; color: aliceblue;">"A retirement home – sometimes called an old people's home or old age home" 
    although old people's home can also refer to a nursing home –
    is a multi-residence housing facility intended for the elderly. 
    Typically, each person or couple in the home has an apartment-style
    suite of rooms.<br><br>


    In my opinion if we all take care our old age parents, give proper love
    and affection,just spend few time with them that is sufficient ,there is
    no need of old age homes.At present what we are it is due to our parents
    they struggled hard to provide our present position , so it is our moral 
    duty that we have to make them happy & should provide all basic survival needs for their life time.
